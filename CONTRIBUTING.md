Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! Quick guidelines:

- Fork the repo and open a pull request against `main`.
- Run `npm install` and `npm test` in the `backend` folder before opening a PR.
- Keep changes small and focused. Add tests for new behavior.
- Use `npm run lint` and `npm run format` to keep code consistent.
